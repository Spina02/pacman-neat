\begin{frame}{Analysis of Emergent Behaviors}
	Analysis of the top-performing agents across curriculum phases reveals a progression in strategy:

	\textbf{Early Generations (Exploration)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemindent{-1em}
		\item Agents acquire basic \bfit{navigation skills}.
		\item Tend to become \bfit{stuck against walls} or exhibit \bfit{oscillatory behavior}.
	\end{itemize}

	\textbf{Mid Generations (Evasion)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemindent{-1em}
		\item Agents begin to \bfit{evade ghosts}, despite little improvement in fitness.
		\item The transition to scatter mode represents the most challenging phase due to \bfit{stochasticity}.
	\end{itemize}
	
	\textbf{Late Generations (Full Game)}
	\begin{itemize}
		\setlength\itemindent{-1em}
		\item Agents gradually adapt to the revised reward structure.
		\item Demonstrate \bfit{improved ghost avoidance} compared to earlier phases.
		\item Continue to \bfit{struggle with effective use of power-ups}.
	\end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Performance Plateau and Model Limitations}
Agents achieve high scores but never ends the level, often getting stuck in "safe" corners, especially the top-left, rather than exploring the maze. Power-ups further reinforce this risk-averse behavior.

Key limitations:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item \bfit{Perception bottleneck:} The 8x8 minimap restricts the agent's view, limiting planning and awareness.
		\item \bfit{No global planning:} The agent cannot avoid traps or optimize routes without a broader perspective.
		\item \bfit{Reward shaping:} The reward function may favor safe, suboptimal strategies like corner camping.
		\item \bfit{Potential improvements:} Richer observations and refined rewards could promote more effective behaviors.
	\end{itemize}
